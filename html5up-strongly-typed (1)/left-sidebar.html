												<h2>What I did. What I do. And what I will do.</h2>
											</header>

											<h3>What I did.</h3>
											<p>My name is Juan Perez and I have played baseball professionally for the last 15 years of my life. Throughout this decade and a half there were many opportunities for growth both on and off the field. Baseball was not as easy as it was for many other players and, trust me, I had to use all my resources to stay competitive. Learning from the ones that came before me, with the old-school mentality, taught me so much of the competitive aspect of baseball. But I was also aware that the game was evolving with the technology world. By applying all the information we had available to us, and working my butt off on the field, I can proudly say that I had a successful career. </p>
											<h3>What I do.</h3>
											<p>Currently, I am on a path to get me to the data science or analytics field. I want to use my years of baseball experience to simplify the translation of raw data into baseball terms. By learning how raw data is treated and manipulated, I can create programs that are directly beneficial to a specific player. Not only will I know what the athlete is looking for, I will know how to create, translate, and communicate that information.</p>
											<h3>What I will do.</h3>
											<p>I will be the middle man between the data "nerds" and the athlete "jocks". I will be able to create programs that are directly beneficial to the athletes because I have been through every part of what it is to be a professional baseball player. I believe that someone who has been in their shoes has more credibility. And applying the tech savvyness to that credibiliity is a recipe for success. </p>
